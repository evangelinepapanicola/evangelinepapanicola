# Hey!
I'm Evangeline. I'm a full-stack web developer at [Hambly Freeman](https://hamblyfreeman.com/) (new website coming soon) where I make pretty websites.


I'm not gonna lie, all of my personal projects on here are so old I'm a bit embarrased by them. But if you really want to check one out, I'd recommend [Nox Caelo](https://github.com/evangelinepapanicola/nox-caelo), a text adventure game I made back in 2019. Just don't judge me too hard, I promise I write much better code nowadays :sweat_smile:

### A bit about me
👩🏻‍💻 [Nuxt](https://github.com/nuxt/nuxt) is my comfort framework, but I am currently dabbling in [Next](https://github.com/vercel/next.js) too.

🎮 Big Final Fantasy nerd

☕🐈 I can survive so long as coffee + cats exist

### A few of the cool sites I've worked on at Hambly Freeman so far

- [Studio Ma](https://studioma.com/)
- [Ballinger](https://www.ballinger.com/)
- [Hide & Seek](https://hideandseekmedia.com/)
