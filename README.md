# Hey!
I'm Evangeline. I'm a full-stack web developer at [Hambly Freeman](https://hamblyfreeman.com/) where I make pretty websites.


I'm not gonna lie, all of my personal projects on here are so old I'm a bit embarrased by them. But if you really want to check one out, I'd recommend [Nox Caelo](https://github.com/evangelinepapanicola/nox-caelo), a text adventure game I made back in 2019. Just don't judge me too hard, I promise I write much better code nowadays :sweat_smile:

### A bit about me
